Iâ€™m currently studying for a Masterâ€™s degree in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science at Lomonosov Moscow State University, Faculty of Computational Mathematics and Cybernetics. Iâ€™m also working as a Deep Learning Engineer at MTS AI.

In my spare time, I like to learn something new about Deep Learning and implement different models with PyTorch. For more information, please visit my [blog](https://dayyass.github.io).
